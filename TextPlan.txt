Make a load of simple functions that take in an int and modify a global variable  

model in discrete time steps . On each tick:

Control rods determine reactivity (how “super-critical” the core is).

Reactivity determines power.

Power heats the fuel.

Fuel transfers heat to coolant.

Coolant carries heat away (depending on pump flow).

We’ll use simple equations with arbitrary units.

state(t + dt) = f(state(t), controls, parameters)
